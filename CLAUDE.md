# AI Contributor Guidelines

**📖 Read @AGENTS.md for comprehensive guidelines on contributing to this repository.**

## 🚨 Critical Git Workflow Rules

**NEVER push directly to `dev` (default branch) or `main` (production branch).**

Always create a feature branch and submit a pull request:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and ALWAYS run tests before committing
yarn workspace @safe-global/web type-check
yarn workspace @safe-global/web lint
yarn workspace @safe-global/web test

# Commit only after tests pass
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your change description"

# Semantic commit prefixes:
# - feat: new features
# - fix: bug fixes
# - chore: CI/CD, build, config changes (NEVER use feat/fix for CI)
# - tests: changes in unit or e2e tests (NEVER use feat/fix for tests)
# - refactor: code refactoring
# - docs: documentation

# Push to your branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a PR via GitHub UI or gh CLI
gh pr create
```

**All tests must pass before committing. Never commit failing code.**
