      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device used
        to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when
        you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language,
        font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don&apos;t have to keep re-entering them
        whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
      </p>

      <h2>What are the different types of cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs.
        <br />
        By lifespan, a cookie is either a:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>session cookie which is erased when the user closes the browser; or</li>
        <li>
          persistent cookie which is saved to the hard drive and remains on the user&apos;s computer/device for a
          pre-defined period of time. As for the domain to which it belongs, cookies are either:
          <ol>
            <li>
              first-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (i.e.
              set by us); or
            </li>
            <li>third-party cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page&apos;s domain.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What cookies do we use and why?</h2>

      <p>
        We list all the cookies we use on this website in the APPENDIX below.
        <br />
        We do not use cookies set by ourselves via our web developers (first-party cookies). We only have those set by
        others (third-party cookies).
        <br />
        Cookies are also sometimes classified by reference to their purpose. We use the following cookies for the
        following purposes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Analytical/performance cookies: They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how
          visitors move around our website when they are using it, as well as dates and times they visit. This helps us
          to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking
          for easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Targeting cookies: These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links
          you have followed, as well as time spent on our website, and the websites visited just before and just after
          our website. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more
          relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In general, we use cookies and other technologies (such as web server logs) on our website to enhance your
        experience and to collect information about how our website is used.
        <br />
        We will retain and evaluate information on your recent visits to our website and how you move around different
        sections of our website for analytics purposes to understand how people use our website so that we can make it
        more intuitive. The information also helps us to understand which parts of this website are most popular and
        generally to assess user behavior and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our
        website. This then allows us to improve our website and the way we market our business.
        <br />
        This information may also be used to help us to improve, administer and diagnose problems with our server and
        website. The information also helps us monitor traffic on our website so that we can manage our website&apos;s
        capacity and efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Technologies</h2>

      <p>
        We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf. In addition to the
        uses of cookies described above, these entities may use other methods, such as the technologies described below,
        to collect information about your use of our website and other websites and online services.
        <br />
        Pixels tags. Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels), are small pieces of code
        that can be embedded on websites and emails. Pixels tags may be used to learn how you interact with our website
        pages and emails, and this information helps us, and our partners provide you with a more tailored experience.
        <br />
        Device Identifiers. A device identifier is a unique label that can be used to identify a mobile device. Device
        identifiers may be used to track, analyze and improve the performance of the website and ads delivered.

      <h3>This information may include:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          the IP and logical address of the server you are using (but the last digits are anonymized so we cannot
          identify you).

        <li>remember if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on our website;</li>

        <li>allow us to store any customization preferences where our website allows this</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We may also use other services, such as{' '}
        <CustomLink href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/#?modal_active=none">Google Analytics</CustomLink>{' '}
        (described below) or other third-party cookies, to assist with analyzing performance on our website. As part of
        providing these services, these service providers may use cookies and the technologies described below to

        of our website, links clicked and conversion information, IP address, browser, mobile network information, and
        type of operating system used.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Analytics Cookies</h2>

      <p>
        This website uses <CustomLink href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</CustomLink>, a web
        analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;).
        <br />
        We use Google Analytics to track your preferences and also to identify popular sections of our website. Use of
        Google Analytics in this way, enables us to adapt the content of our website more specifically to your needs and
        thereby improve what we can offer to you.
        <br />
        Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on
        website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet
        usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such
        third parties process the information on Google&apos;s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with
        any other data held by Google.
        <br />
        In particular Google Analytics tells us:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>your IP address (last 3 digits are masked);</li>
        <li>the number of pages visited;</li>
        <li>the time and duration of the visit;</li>
        <li>your location;</li>
        <li>the website you came from (if any);</li>
        <li>the type of hardware you use (i.e. whether you are browsing from a desktop or a mobile device);</li>
        <li>the software used (type of browser); and</li>
        <li>your general interaction with our website.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        As stated above, cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally, and what is compiled is only
        aggregate data that tells us, for example, what countries we are most popular in, but not that you live in a
        particular country or your precise location when you visited our website (this is because we have only half the
        information- we know the country the person is browsing from, but not the name of person who is browsing). In
        such an example Google will analyze the number of users for us, but the relevant cookies do not reveal their
        identities.
        <br />
        By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the
        purposes set out above. Google Analytics, its purpose and function is further explained on the{' '}
        <CustomLink href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics website</CustomLink>.
        <br />

      <h2>Product analytics via Mixpanel</h2>

      <p>
