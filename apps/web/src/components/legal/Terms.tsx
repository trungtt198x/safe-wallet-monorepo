        &quot;<strong>Token</strong>&quot; means a digital asset transferred in a Transaction, including ETH, ERC20,
        ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
      </p>

      <p>

        assets by correlation of a (i) Public Key and (ii) a Private Key, or a Smart Contract to receive, manage and

      </p>

      <h1 id="3-what-are-the-services-offered">3. What are the Services offered?</h1>

      <p>
        Our services (&quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;) primarily consist of enabling users to create their Safe
        Accounts and ongoing interaction with it on the Blockchain.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            &quot;<strong>Safe Account</strong>&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            A Safe Account is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based wallet not
            provided by Safe Labs. Safe Accounts are open-source released under LGPL-3.0.
          </p>

          <p>
            Smart contract wallet means, unlike a standard private key Wallet, that access control for authorizing any
            Transaction is defined in code. An example are multi-signature wallets which require that any Transaction
            must be signed by a minimum number of signing wallets whereby the specifics of the requirements to authorize
            a Transaction can be configured in code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Owners need to connect a signing wallet with a Safe Account. Safe Accounts are compatible inter alia with
            standard private key Wallets such as hardware wallets, browser extension wallets and mobile wallets that
            support WalletConnect.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            &quot;<strong>Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App</strong>&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            You may access Safe Accounts using the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; web app, the mobile app
            &quot;Safe&#123;Mobile&#125;&quot; for iOS and Android, or the browser extension (each a
            &quot;Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App&quot;). The Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App may be used to manage your personal
            digital assets on Ethereum and other common EVM chains when you connect a Safe Account with third-party
            services (as defined below). The Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App provides certain features that may be amended
            from time to time.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the extent you use our Services via the mobile app &quot;Safe&#123;Mobile&#125;&quot;, you acknowledge
            that this use may be governed by additional terms provided by the operators of the app store (such as the
            Apple App Store or Google Play Store). You acknowledge that you have to comply with both this Agreement and
            any applicable app store terms of service. In case of conflict, this Agreement shall prevail.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            &quot;<strong>Third-Party Safe Apps</strong>&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App allows you to connect Safe Accounts to third-party applications
            (&quot;Third-Party Safe Apps&quot;) and use third-party services such as from the decentralized finance
            sector, DAO tools or services related to NFTs (&quot;Third-Party Services&quot;). The Third-Party Safe Apps
            are integrated in the user interface of the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App via inline framing. The provider of
            the Third-Party Safe App and/or related Third-Party Services is responsible for the operation of the service
            and the correctness, completeness and actuality of any information provided therein. We make a pre-selection
            of Third-Party Safe Apps that we show in the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; App. However, we only perform a rough
            triage in advance for obvious problems and functionality in terms of loading time and resolution capability
            of the transactions. Accordingly, in the event of any (technical) issues concerning the Third-Party
            Services, the user must only contact the respective service provider directly. The terms of service, if any,
            shall be governed by the applicable contractual provisions between the User and the respective provider of
            the Third-Party Safe Apps or Third-Party Services. Accordingly, we are not liable in the event of a breach
            of contract, damage or loss related to the use of such Third-Party Safe Apps or Third-Party Services.
