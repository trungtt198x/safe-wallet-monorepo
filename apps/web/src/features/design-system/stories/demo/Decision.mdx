# Design System Approach - Decision Guide

After implementing the Dashboard Overview demo with both patterns, here's a summary to help the team decide.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Direct Pattern | Wrapped Pattern |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Imports** | `@/components/ui/*` | `@/features/design-system` |
| **Learning curve** | Low (shadcn docs) | Medium (custom docs) |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium |
| **Consistency** | Manual | Enforced |
| **Loading states** | DIY | Built-in |
| **Safe semantics** | No | Yes |
| **Maintenance** | Low | Medium |

## Direct Pattern

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card'

<Button variant="default">Send</Button>
```

**Best for:**
- Rapid prototyping
- One-off designs
- Maximum flexibility
- Following shadcn community patterns

## Wrapped Pattern

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@/features/design-system'
// or
import { Wrapped } from '@/features/design-system'

<Wrapped.Button loading={isSending}>Send</Wrapped.Button>
```

**Best for:**
- Production features
- Team consistency
- Safe-specific behavior (loading, error states)
- Easier onboarding

## Recommendation

**Hybrid approach:**

1. **Use Direct** for:
   - Experiments in `stories/experiments/`
   - Prototyping new features
   - Components with unique requirements

2. **Use Wrapped** for:
   - Production features
   - Components that need loading/error states
   - Team members who want consistency

3. **Both work together:**
   - Wrapped components use shadcn internally
   - Switch between patterns as needed
   - No lock-in either way

## Next Steps

1. **Review the demos** in this Storybook section
2. **Discuss** which pattern feels right for the team
3. **Start a feature** with the chosen pattern
4. **Iterate** based on real-world usage

The beauty of this setup is that you can change your mind later without rewriting everything.
