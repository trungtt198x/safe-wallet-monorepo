# Code-First Design Experiments

This folder is for **prototyping and experimenting** with new component designs directly in code. The goal is to enable rapid iteration without waiting for Figma handoffs.

## Workflow

1. **Create a new story** in this folder (e.g., `MyPrototype.stories.tsx`)
2. **Build the component** using design system atoms and molecules
3. **Iterate in real-time** - Storybook hot-reloads in under 2 seconds
4. **Share with design** - Deploy PR staging to get feedback
5. **Refine** - Adjust based on feedback, all in code
6. **Promote** - Once approved, move to proper component location

## Benefits

- **Instant feedback**: See changes immediately in Storybook
- **Real constraints**: Work with actual CSS, tokens, and responsive behavior
- **Shareable**: Anyone can view the PR staging URL
- **Versionable**: All experiments are tracked in git

## Example: Creating a Prototype

```tsx
// experiments/NewFeatureCard.stories.tsx
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'

const NewFeatureCard = () => (
  <Card className="w-[400px]">
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
        New Feature
        <Badge variant="secondary">Beta</Badge>
      </CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      <p>Try out this new feature!</p>
      <Button className="mt-4">Enable</Button>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)

export default {
  title: 'Design System/Experiments/NewFeatureCard',
  component: NewFeatureCard,
}

export const Default = {}
```

## Tips

- **Use existing tokens**: Stick to CSS variables from the design system
- **Keep it simple**: Start with the minimal viable prototype
- **Document decisions**: Add comments explaining design choices
- **Clean up**: Delete experiments that were rejected or promoted

## Graduating Components

When an experiment is approved:

1. Move to `components/atoms/wrapped/` or `components/molecules/wrapped/`
2. Add proper TypeScript types
3. Create comprehensive Storybook stories
4. Delete the experiment
