# Contracts: Bridge Feature Refactor

This directory is empty because the bridge feature refactor does not introduce any API contracts.

The bridge feature is a pure UI refactoring that:

- Reorganizes file structure to match the standard pattern
- Creates barrel files for public API
- Updates import paths

No new APIs, endpoints, or programmatic interfaces are created.
